          <h2>HERBAL MEDICINES</h2>
          <p>The use of plants for healing purposes predates human history and forms the origin of much modern medicine. Many conventional drugs originate from plant sources: a century ago, most of the few effective drugs were plant based. Examples include aspirin (from willow bark), digoxin (from foxglove), quinine (from cinchona bark), and morphine (from the opium poppy). The development of drugs from plants continues, with drug companies engaged in large scale pharmacological screening of herbs.
            Chinese herbalism is the most prevalent of the ancient herbal traditions currently practised in Britain. It is based on concepts of yin and yang and of Qi energy. Chinese herbs are ascribed qualities such as “cooling” (yin) or “stimulating” (yang) and used, often in combination, according to the deficiencies or excesses of these qualities in the patient.

          <h2>HERBAL REMEDIES</h2>
          <p>Conservative estimates suggest that at least 12 percent of the U.S. population uses herbal medicines, and the number is increasing, yet these products are not regulated by the Food and Drug Administration. This review considers the evidence on the safety and efficacy of herbal medicines, focusing on four – Ginkgo biloba, hawthorn, saw palmetto, and St. John's wort – that have been evaluated in a sufficient number of randomized, controlled trials to permit an assessment.

          <h2>HERBAL DRUGS</h2>
          <p>The use of herbal drugs for the prevention and treatment of various health ailments has been in practice from time immemorial. Generally it is believed that the risk associated with herbal drugs is very less, but reports on serious reactions are indicating to the need for development of effective marker systems for isolation and identification of the individual components. Standards for herbal drugs are being developed worldwide but as yet there is no common consensus as to how these should be adopted. Standardization, stability and quality control for herbal drugs are feasible, but difficult to accomplish. Further, the regulation of these drugs is not uniform across countries. There are variations in the methods used across medicine systems and countries in achieving stability and quality control. The present study attempts to identify the evolution of technical standards in manufacturing and the regulatory guideline development for commercialization of herbal drugs.

          <h2>HERBAL EXTRACTS</h2>
          <p>The antimicrobial activity of total herbal extracts has been investigated. The MIC of extracts of Evodia rutaecarpa and grape kernel ranged between 0.25 and 1 mg/ml against gram-positive cocci and P. aeruginosa. Cocci were killed after 30 – 90 min of incubation in grape kernel extract (0.5 – 1.5 mg/ml), and after 8 h in evodia extract (0.5 – 1 mg/ml), respectively. C. albicans was only susceptible to evodia (MIC 0.5 mg/ml).

            The organic solvents of the preparations contributed to the antibacterial effect of herbal extracts with MICs of ethanol between 4 and 10 vol% and those of methanol between 6 and 10 vol%. Taking this into consideration, mastic and thyme extracts exerted hardly any microbicidal activity, while grape kernel extract and evodia were still effective at 2- to 6-fold dilutions below the MIC of the solvent. Because of the weak antimicrobial activity of total herbal extracts we recommend to give preference to preparations of single or more purified compounds.

          <h2>HERBAL SUPPLEMENTS</h2>
          <p>Many patients use herbal supplements to treat chronic cardiovascular conditions and often combine herbal ingredients with cardiovascular medications. However, physicians do not reliably elicit a history of herbal use from their patients and may overlook herbal supplements' adverse effects. Although often considered harmless by patients, herbal supplements may cause adverse cardiovascular effects from an herbal ingredient, a contaminant, or an herb–drug interaction. Herbal stimulants, including bitter orange, ephedra, caffeine, guarana, maté, kola, areca, lobelia, khat, and others are the most common category of herbal therapies to cause cardiovascular effects. However, dozens of other herbal ingredients have also been linked to adverse cardiovascular events. In addition to listed ingredients, herbal supplements may become contaminated at a number of stages during production. Pesticides, heavy metals, bacteria, and pharmaceutical agents have been detected in herbal supplements. Supposedly “herbal” products that are adulterated with prescription anorectics, antidepressants, diuretics, phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitors along with other medications have been identified throughout Europe, North America, and Asia. All of these adulterants have potential cardiovascular effects. Herbal interactions with a variety of cardiovascular medications may also lead to adverse events. Herbal ingredients may cause pharmacokinetic as well as pharmacodynamic herb–drug interactions. We review clinically relevant patterns of adverse cardiovascular reactions to herbal supplements, and we provide resources and recommendations for practicing cardiologists evaluating patients with suspected herbal adverse effects.
